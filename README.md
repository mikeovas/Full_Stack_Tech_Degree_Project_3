 Interactive Form

In this project, JavaScript  was used to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

HTML and CSS project files were given to create the form and its styles while JavaScript was used to make the form more user-friendly.
    * Customized and conditional behavior and interactivity was added using javascript:
        -   Choice of job role were given and if other was chosen as a job choice, an input box appeares for the user to enter a job decription not part of the choices given.
        -   Tshirt colors specific to design selected
        -   Total Cost of Activites selected
        -   Selection of only activities that did not occur on the same day and time was ensured
        -   Payment information relevent to the selection of Payment Option was ensured.
    
    * Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields
        - This was done for User name, email and payment information inputs to check for correct formats using regex expressions
